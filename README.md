# Building-with-Polygon-Bridge

**NFT Project Deployment Guide**

### Overview
This project involves deploying an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain and mapping it to the Polygon network to increase demand and save on gas fees. The collection will consist of 5 unique items generated using DALLE 2 or Midjourney. The images for the NFTs will be stored on IPFS using pinata.cloud. The NFTs will be deployed as ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. A promptDescription function will be included in the contract to return the prompt used to generate the images. Additionally, a hardhat script will be written to batch mint all NFTs, and another script will be written to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge.

### Steps

1. **Generate NFT Images:**
   Use DALLE 2 or Midjourney to generate 5 unique images for the NFT collection.

2. **Store Images on IPFS:**
   Upload the generated images to IPFS using pinata.cloud to ensure decentralized storage.

3. **Deploy NFT Contract to Goerli Testnet:**
   Write and deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. Ensure that the contract includes a promptDescription function to return the prompt used for image generation.

4. **Map NFT Collection to Polygon Network:**
   Use the Polygon network token mapper to map the NFT collection to the Polygon network. Although not necessary, it helps with visualization and interoperability.

5. **Write Hardhat Script for Batch Minting:**
   Create a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs. This script should be optimized for ERC721A for efficient minting.

6. **Write Hardhat Script for Batch Transfer:**
   Develop a hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge. This script should handle the transfer process securely and efficiently.

### Repository Structure
- **/contracts**: Contains the Solidity smart contract code for the ERC721 or ERC1155 token.
- **/scripts**: Includes the hardhat scripts for batch minting and batch transfer.
- **/images**: Stores the generated NFT images.
- **README.md**: Provides instructions and documentation for the project.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Ensure you have access to Ethereum and Polygon networks for deployment and testing.
4. Follow the instructions in the README.md file to deploy the NFT collection and execute the scripts.

### Usage
- Follow the provided instructions in the README.md file to deploy the NFT collection and execute the scripts.
- Ensure proper network configurations and account access for deployment and transactions.
- Monitor the deployment process and verify successful mapping and transfer of NFTs to the Polygon network.

### Disclaimer
- Make sure to handle private keys and sensitive information securely.
- Test the deployment process thoroughly before executing it on the mainnet.
- Be aware of gas fees and network congestion, especially during deployment and transactions.
